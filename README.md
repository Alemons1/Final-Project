# Life At Mizzou

The first semester here at _Mizzou_ has been a blast. I met a lot of people, learned alot, and even got involved within the student body. Dorm life? Not so much. The community style bathrooms are the worst thing ever and the laundry rooms are at a close 2nd. 

When it comes to food, that's a different story. The food has been top tier since the first week. In my opinion, southwest is the best cafeteria because of variety and quality of the food. Also one thing for certain is that Plaza 900 is the absolute worst. It has it's days where it can be good but overall it's the last on my list.
